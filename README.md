# Skin-Cancer-Detection

## The Purpose

We wanted to make the detection of skin 
cancer easy and accessible to anyone at home. We 
also wanted be able to give the average person 
some insight into why you should ultimately go 
to a dermatologist if you have concerns of cancer, 
as well as raise awareness of the risks of not 
properly dealing with something that is potentially 
dangerous.

## The Data

Our data. The data we used comes from 2 main sources. 
The images we used to train our model come from the 
archives at the International Skin Imaging Collaboration, 
and our facts and statistics come from the Skin Cancer 
Foundation. The source for our images provided over 
70,000 images for use, along with patient information 
for each photo. Most of our work with the data 
consisted of labeling, which we did using folders 
for each class of photos, split into training, test, 
and validation sets. These images came from real 
cases from patients having bot benign and malignant 
lesions.

## Results

The model we created held about an 80% accuracy rate 
in predicting whether or not a skin lesion is 
malignant or not. Some precancerous lesions were 
harder to detect and so its import to still go to 
a doctor  to get any concerns looked at by a 
dermatologist. Many of the models created were 
commented out due to machine limitations.

## Conclusion

For the untrained eye, skin cancer can be difficult 
to detect, and even doctors get it wrong sometimes. 
Our model was able to predict skin cancer about 80% 
of the time. While there is a clear difference between 
malignant and benign skin lesions, precancerous lesion 
can be particularly difficult to detect as they hold
 a lot of similarities to totally benign lesions. 
This model can be a great way to get a good idea on 
a skin lesion, however a biopsy would even be 
recommended by a doctor in these cases  so a 
doctor's visit is necessary to be safe.
